# This is the local configuration for the poetry-command.
# Official docs: https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#available-settings
#
# Poetry provides the ability to have settings that are specific to a project
# by passing the --local option to the config command.
# Please see https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/

[virtualenvs]

# Directory where virtual environments will be created. Defaults to {cache-dir}/virtualenvs
# path = ""

# Create the virtualenv inside the project’s root directory. Defaults to None.
# If set to true, the virtualenv wil be created and expected in a folder named .venv within the root directory of the project.
# If not set explicitly (default), poetry will use the virtualenv from the .venv directory when one is available.
# If set to false, poetry will ignore any existing .venv directory
# > poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local

# Create a new virtual environment if one doesn’t already exist. Defaults to true.
# > poetry config virtualenvs.create true --local

[warnings]
# Warning: poetry-plugin-export will not be installed by default in a future version of Poetry.
# In order to avoid a breaking change and make your automation forward-compatible, 
# please install poetry-plugin-export explicitly. 
# See https://python-poetry.org/docs/plugins/#using-plugins for details on how to install a plugin.
# To disable this warning run 'poetry config warnings.export false'.
